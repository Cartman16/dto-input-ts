# dto-input-ts

DTO-Input is a TypeScript helper library for reading GPIO pins from the device tree utilizing the [device tree overlay] (https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md) from the linux kernel. Using device tree overlays should enable you using this library on every single board computer. 

In my sample implementation I use only a button and a rotary encoder.

This project was inspired by [fivdi's gpio-button project](https://github.com/fivdi/gpio-button).
